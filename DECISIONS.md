Use the same GH key you have to pull this . 

Now it's get a bit tricky since you can't view it. 

use that gh key, init it as submodule in this project . then you can see how to install , what is it capabilities . 

then we will integrate it into interpreter/core/computer/asq (just import the functionalities in asq and re export it correctly for the main interpreter of this project to consume )
It will just be like one of the other modules (computer/browser, computer/calendar, ...)

write me another decision file after you init asq as a submodule and read through it to understand what's it about, how your would structure it, where to modify .
