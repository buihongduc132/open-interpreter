# DECISIONS REQUIRED

Before proceeding with the integration of the ASQ module into the open-interpreter computer modules, I need clarification on several ambiguous points from the INSTRUCTIONS.md:

## 1. ASQ Module Access
**Issue**: The ASQ repository (https://github.com/buihongduc132/asq) appears to be private or inaccessible (404 error).

**Options**:
- [ ] A. The ASQ module is already available locally in the project
- [ ] B. I need to create the ASQ module from scratch based on requirements
- [ ] C. You will provide access credentials or make the repository public
- [ ] D. The ASQ module should be downloaded from a different source

**Please specify**: _______________

## 2. ASQ Module Functionality
**Issue**: The instructions don't specify what the ASQ module should do or what methods it should expose.

**Questions**:
- What is the primary purpose of the ASQ module? 
  - [ ] A. Database querying (ASQ = Advanced SQL Query)
  - [ ] B. Asynchronous operations
  - [ ] C. Audio/Sound processing
  - [ ] D. Other: _______________

- What methods should be re-exported for the open-interpreter LLM?
  **Please list the methods**: _______________

## 3. Integration Location
**Issue**: Where exactly should the ASQ module be integrated within the computer modules?

**Options**:
- [ ] A. Create a new `/workspace/interpreter/core/computer/asq/` directory
- [ ] B. Integrate into an existing module (specify which): _______________
- [ ] C. Add as a utility in `/workspace/interpreter/core/computer/utils/`
- [ ] D. Other location: _______________

## 4. Installation Requirements
**Issue**: How should the ASQ module be installed and made available?

**Options**:
- [ ] A. Add to pyproject.toml dependencies
- [ ] B. Include as a local module (no external dependency)
- [ ] C. Install via pip during setup
- [ ] D. Other method: _______________

## 5. Export Strategy
**Issue**: How should the ASQ methods be re-exported for the LLM?

**Options**:
- [ ] A. Add to main computer.__init__.py
- [ ] B. Create separate asq attribute on computer object
- [ ] C. Merge methods into existing modules
- [ ] D. Other approach: _______________

## 6. Testing Requirements
**Issue**: What level of testing is expected?

**Options**:
- [ ] A. Unit tests for all ASQ methods
- [ ] B. Integration tests with open-interpreter
- [ ] C. Manual testing only
- [ ] D. No testing required

## 7. Documentation
**Issue**: What documentation should be created/updated?

**Options**:
- [ ] A. Update computer_capabilities.md with ASQ features
- [ ] B. Create separate ASQ documentation
- [ ] C. Add examples to USAGE.md
- [ ] D. All of the above
