# TODO 05: High-Level API Development

**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours  

## Objective
Create comprehensive high-level GUI automation API that provides intuitive methods for common desktop automation tasks, making it easy for LLMs to interact with desktop applications.

## Detailed Steps

### ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
1. **Application Management API** - Methods for launching, managing, and interacting with applications
2. **Dialog and Modal Handling** - Specialized methods for handling dialogs, alerts, and modal windows
3. **File Operations API** - High-level methods for file dialogs, save/open operations
4. **Text Processing API** - Advanced text manipulation and extraction methods
5. **Workflow Automation** - Composite methods for common automation workflows
6. **Screen Capture Integration** - Methods for taking screenshots and visual verification

### ðŸ“‹ TO DO
1. **Create application management module**:
   - Launch applications by name or path
   - Switch between applications
   - Close applications gracefully
   - Get application information and status
2. **Implement dialog handling**:
   - Detect and handle common dialog types
   - File dialogs (open, save, browse)
   - Alert dialogs (info, warning, error)
   - Confirmation dialogs (yes/no, ok/cancel)
3. **Add file operations**:
   - Open file dialogs and select files
   - Save file dialogs with filename input
   - Browse folder dialogs
   - Recent files handling
4. **Create text processing methods**:
   - Extract text from complex UI elements
   - Search and replace in text fields
   - Text formatting and manipulation
   - Copy/paste operations
5. **Implement workflow automation**:
   - Login workflows (username/password)
   - Form submission workflows
   - Multi-step processes
   - Conditional workflows based on UI state
6. **Add screen capture features**:
   - Take screenshots of specific elements
   - Visual verification of UI state
   - Image-based element finding
   - OCR integration for text extraction

### ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Application management API working
- [ ] Dialog handling for common dialog types
- [ ] File operations API functional
- [ ] Text processing methods implemented
- [ ] Workflow automation methods available
- [ ] Screen capture integration working
- [ ] All methods properly documented
- [ ] Integration tests passing

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on common use cases and workflows
- Provide both simple and advanced options
- Maintain consistency with existing ASQ API
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include visual feedback and logging

## Dependencies
- ASQ core modules (already implemented)
- Screenshot libraries (PIL, pyautogui)
- OCR libraries (optional: pytesseract)
- File system utilities

## Summary
ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS**: Creating comprehensive high-level API for common desktop automation tasks and workflows.

## Next Task
â†’ **06-error-handling**: Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
